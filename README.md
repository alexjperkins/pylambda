## Please NOTE:

This is currently a *Work In Progress*
What started of as an attempt to learn
Lambda-calculus and by extension a 
Deeper understanding of recursion has
Led to the attempt to write a scheme 
interpreter in python

I will be breaking things and fast due to
time constraints. *DO NOT* expect everything
to work, until I version, since it's still at
the PoC stage.

Wish me luck!
